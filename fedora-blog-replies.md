Hi all! I tried commenting on https://fedoramagazine.org/4-cool-new-projects-to-try-in-copr-from-october-2020/ , but 1. had to give clearance on my https://www.shlomifish.org/ openid (Ok) 2. then i had to login to FAS again (which had forgotten my login and so i had to unlock ff's password manager using the master pw). 3. Then noscript complained about a potential xss. 4, after that I was redirected to an obscure wordpress admin page and when i returned to the blog post my reply's text was lost. "Something is rotten in the state of Denmark". As much as I used to hate wordpress (see https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/2icta2/when_wishing_to_comment_on_a_wordpress_blog/ ), commenting on these posts of other blogs was fairly straightforward: https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question/ ; https://www.davidrevoy.com/article767/episode-32-the-battlefield#comments . Can the process on https://fedoramagazine.org/ please be streamlined?
