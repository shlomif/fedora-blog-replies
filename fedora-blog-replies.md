Hi all!

I tried commenting on https://fedoramagazine.org/4-cool-new-projects-to-try-in-copr-from-october-2020/ , but:

1. had to give clearance on my https://www.shlomifish.org/ openid (Ok)

2. Then I had to login to FAS again (which had forgotten my login and so i had to unlock firefox's password manager using the master password).

3. Then noscript complained about a potential XSS.

4. after that I was redirected to an obscure wordpress admin page and when I returned to the blog post my reply's text was lost.

"Something is rotten in the state of Denmark".

As much as I used to hate wordpress (see https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/2icta2/when_wishing_to_comment_on_a_wordpress_blog/ and http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/WordPress/ ),
commenting on these posts of other blogs was fairly straightforward: https://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2010/08/29/writing-the-perfect-question/ ; https://www.davidrevoy.com/article767/episode-32-the-battlefield#comments .

Can the process on https://fedoramagazine.org/ please be streamlined?

**Update**: a Fedora admin of its web sites on [freenode](https://freenode.net/) gave me a workaround
of not entering my openid URL, which will make it harder for people to contact me.

He noted that he will look into fixing this issue but will likely fail. Fedora is developed by [Red Hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat)
which used to be very profitable before it was sold to IBM for 34 milliard dollars, and
Fedora/[RHEL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux) are popular and tend to get the final say even
over Ubuntu. They can afford to hire top talent, and I presume also have many contributors who volunteer
